  A few of the projects I have worked on over the course of my degree. Two of these projects I am most proud of are:

    <li>HeartLink ❤</li>
<!--    <ul>
      <li>A digital stethoscope that allows patients to take recordings of heart sounds and send them to clinicians remotely</li>
      <li>I focussed on implementing the server in Go</li>
    </ul> -->
    <li>Blackjack Strategist 🃏</li>
  </ul>
