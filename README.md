          - *Main Contributions*
            - Set up the Golang server to be hosted on Google Cloud
            - Designed and implemented necessary server endpoints (GET, POST, and DELETE) to properly link the device/app/website together with the databases
            - Used Postman to unit test each endpoint before integration testing of the entire workflow
      - **Blackjack Strategist** 🃏
          - *Project Overview*
              - Image processing project to analyze a players hand in the popular game 'Blackjack' and recommend the mathematically optimal next move

              - Collected data to test image processing capabilities
              - Set up game controller in Python, allowing user to input images of current hand after each decision 
              - Helped utilize OpenCV to process input images and read card values using OCR algorithm
